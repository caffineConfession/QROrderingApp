  // Route Handlers in App Router don't easily expose the raw Node.js req, socket, and head.
  // This is a significant challenge for using the `ws` library's `handleUpgrade` directly here.
  // Vercel's official examples for WebSockets with App Router often involve Edge runtime or more complex setups.

  // This specific `GET` handler in an App Router `route.ts` file is expected by clients
  // trying to establish a WebSocket connection. If `ws.handleUpgrade` cannot be called
  // correctly here due to lack of access to underlying Node.js objects from `req: NextRequest`,
  // the WebSocket handshake will fail.

  // The following is a conceptual placeholder for where `handleUpgrade` *would* go
  // if `req`, `socket`, and `head` were available from the `NextRequest`.
  // In a typical Node.js + Express setup, this would be straightforward.

  const upgradeHeader = req.headers.get('upgrade');
  
  if (upgradeHeader !== 'websocket') {
    return new NextResponse("Expected WebSocket upgrade request", { status: 400 });
  }

  // Attempting to handle the upgrade requires the underlying socket.
  // This is the part that's difficult with just `NextRequest`.
  // For a robust solution in App Router, consider:
  // 1. A custom Next.js server (`server.js`) where you have full control over the HTTP server.
  // 2. Libraries like `next-ws` which abstract this complexity.
  // 3. Vercel's specific guidance if deploying there (might involve Edge functions).

  // Since this prototype must work within current constraints (no custom server file, no new major libs):
  // This `GET` handler essentially indicates the endpoint exists for WebSockets,
  // but the actual upgrade mechanism relies on the `ws` server being correctly
  // initialized and able to handle upgrades globally or via a custom server setup.
  // The `initializeWebSocketServer()` call in `websocket.ts` sets up `wss` with `noServer: true`.
  // The `handleUpgrade` logic is supposed to be invoked by the main HTTP server when it sees an upgrade request.
  // Without direct access to that server's upgrade event here, this GET handler cannot complete the handshake.
  
  // The current structure with `initializeWebSocketServer({ noServer: true })` means
  // that the HTTP server which Next.js runs needs to be configured to pass upgrade requests
  // to `wss.handleUpgrade`. This is not done automatically by a simple API route.

  // console.log("/api/orders/ws GET hit, WebSocket server should handle upgrade if main server is configured.");
  // Because we cannot complete `handleUpgrade` here with `NextRequest`,
  // we return a "method not allowed" or similar, as this HTTP GET itself isn't a traditional API.
  // The actual WebSocket connection would happen at a lower level if the server is set up for it.
  // For now, to signify the endpoint is for WebSockets, but cannot be handled by standard HTTP GET:
  return new NextResponse(null, { status: 101 }); // Switching Protocols (client will see this as failed if not actual WS upgrade)

  // A more correct approach IF we had the raw req, socket, head:
  /*
  const nodeReq = req as unknown as IncomingMessage; // This cast is unsafe / illustrative
  const socket = nodeReq.socket as Socket & { server: any }; // Also unsafe
  const head = Buffer.alloc(0); // Illustrative

  if (socket.server.listeners('upgrade').length === 0) {
    // If no global upgrade listener is set up (e.g. by a custom server)
    // try to handle it here, though this is still not ideal.
     wss.handleUpgrade(nodeReq, socket, head, (ws) => {
       wss.emit('connection', ws, nodeReq);
     });
  } else {
    // If there's a global listener, it means a custom server is likely handling it.
    // This API route GET shouldn't do anything further.
    // However, how does the client know the connection succeeded without an explicit 101 from *here*?
    // This indicates that WebSocket upgrades are best handled outside of simple API route GET handlers.
  }
  // Crucially, you don't return a NextResponse if the upgrade is successful.
  */
}

// You might also need a POST or other methods if clients send HTTP requests for other reasons.
// But for pure WebSocket, GET for handshake is typical.
